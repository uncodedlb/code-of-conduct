# Uncoded Policy Documents

These documents help define who we are, how we act, and guide our decisions.  In most cases they were adopted from other open source communities and modified to fit our own.  We ask you to read them to understand our ideals and guiding principles.  We also encourage your input to help us improve them.  Please use a pull request and issue queue to suggest changes.
